    <p id="one">"Pleasure makes you choose something, but the troubles you must endure. You have the option in
        everything, even if some things are corrupt by nature. The blessed and distinct things are excepted, and you
        often achieve them. The pains that belong to those matters bring greater benefits later, even though they seem
        unpleasant.".</p>
